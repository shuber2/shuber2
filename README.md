# Stefan Huber

I am a professor at Salzburg University of Applied Sciences. I am a computer
scientist and mathematician with industrial background in the industrial
automation industry.

My [research interests](https://www.sthu.org/research/) in chronological order
encompassed algorithm theory, computational and discrete geometry,
computational topology, machine learning and artificial intelligence,
industrial automation and robotics, and a bit of cybersecurity.

Since the mid 90s I am a passionate programmer in various languages, but a
certain focus in C, C++ and Python. And I am passionate about [open source
software](https://www.sthu.org/code/noncommercial.html). I am a user of Gentoo
Linux and (neo)vim roughly since the mid 2000s.
